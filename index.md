### N-Grams

Created bigram and unigram dictionaries for English, French, and Italian, using the provided training data, where the key is the unigram or bigram text and the value is the count of that unigram or bigram in the data. Then, calculated probabilities for each language and compare against the true labels.

## Text Classification Part 1 

Used the [Email Spam Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balaka18/email-spam-classification-dataset-csv) to perform Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks in order to determine how accurate each Machine Learning algorithm is, in determining whether the email is spam or not spam.

## Text Classification Part 2

Used the [Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews) to perform LTSM, CNN, and different Embedding approaches to determine which model can predict whether a customer would recommend a product based on the customer's review text.
